In this folder, create a log-insight project with the following requirements:
1. Main purpose of the project: collect logs from various parts of a software project during production usage, provide login logs, and provide logs for the number of tokens used per single large model request.
2. Create two separate projects (frontend and backend).
  - Frontend project: built with React.
  - Backend project: built with Node.js.
3. The backend project should be named log-insight-backend and provide the following functions:
a. Provide a login API for the frontend, with username and password stored in a local .env file.
b. Provide general log APIs, where uploads to these APIs do not require login.
c. Provide a login log API, and record a log entry whenever a user logs into the system.
d. Provide an API to log the number of tokens used in a single large model request, where uploads do not require login.
4. The frontend project should be named log-insight-ui and provide the following functions:
a. Login functionality: call the log-insight-backend login API to authenticate, and all pages require login to be accessed.
b. Display logs from log-insight-backend, with search and pagination features.
c. Allow log deletion based on conditions and date.
5. Data storage: use pino to store logs into local files.
